##Challange 1
```{r, echo=TRUE}
v <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed"
```

```{r}
u <- gsub("[[:punct:]]","",v)
u
```
this is what I did to get rid of the puncuations because if they are in this it wont work
```{r}
library(stringr)
u2 <- str_split(u, " ", n=22, simplify = FALSE) 
u2
```
This is what I used to sapersate everything out and split it into different parts
```{r}
u3 <- unlist(u2)
u3
```
This was used so the project wouldnt be in a list and I could select the individual stuff
```{r}
u4 <- u3[seq(from = 1, to = 22, by = 3)] 
u4
```
This was a way to select every 3rd word after the list was unlisted
